Surface modification with coatings can be adjusted to provide the highest service performance at the lowest cost. Coatings can increase corrosion resistance by reducing metal ion and corrosion product migration in the body. We fabricated polymer based bio-composite coatings by blending chitosan (Chi), alginate (Alg) and nanoparticles ((TiO2, Nb2O5) by dip coating onto a 316L stainless steel substrate. The coatings’ surface morphology and phases were studied using FESEM and FTIR analysis. The wettability behavior of the coated samples was also studied by investigating their contact wetting attributes. The antibacterial activity of the functionalized coatings was determined too. The FTIR results showed that the blending of Chi-Alg and nanoparticles was excellent, and no obvious differences in the spectra or any changes in the structures of the polymer matrices were observed. The SEM results demonstrated that the coating layers were uniform, homogeneous, and crack-free on the 316L Stianless steel substrate when using TiO2-Nb2O5 nano particles. The contact angle results showed the highly hydrophilic properties of the pure chitosan-alginate blend. As well, coatings containing nano particles showed the same antibacterial effect of chitosan-alginate blend coating.\n",

            "Optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater is the key factor for conjunctive water management. Proper planning is necessary for optimal allocation of water for maximizing crop yield benefits and/or minimizing water quality problems. With the advent of computers, by the late 1960s, computer-aided mathematical models came into use to help decision-makers in planning conjunctive water management. Optimization models were popular in the early decades. Then researchers came to know the advantage of mimicking the situations and analyzing them before arriving at optimal solutions. Thus, simulation models and integrated simulation-optimization models came into existence. Multi-objective models were developed to solve more complicated physical situations. The computational burden of running thousands or lakhs of simulations before getting an optimum solution, generated evolution algorithms like ANN and GA to reduce the running time of models and obtain a more accurate solution. Even now we can’t say the modelling approach is perfect to solve the real-world water-related issues that involve complicated physical phenomenon. A model which is more accurate, simpler and very near to real situations, may be developed in near future.\n",

A key distinction to prior works is that this article considers sensor nodes aided by backscatter communications, which allow them to communicate with negligible energy cost using ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. The article contains three main novelties. First, it presents a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that can be used to compute the global optimal solution. Second, it also outlines a centralized greedy scheduling (CGS) algorithm that selects nodes based on their energy and the number of covered targets. Third, it presents a distributed greedy scheduling (DGS) algorithm that selects nodes according to their energy level.

            "In the conventional two-way relay nonorthogonal multiple access (TWR-NOMA) system, its diversity order is equal to zero even under the perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC). In this article, we leverage multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) technique in the TWR-NOMA system to extract spatial diversity gain for the performance enhancement. Communications between two user pairs are assisted by a relay. Precoding vectors at users as well as the matrix at the relay are specially designed to perform the signal alignment (SA). We derive analytical closed-form expressions for the outage probability and diversity order with both pSIC and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). In addition, the ergodic rate and ergodic sum rate are analyzed. Optimal power allocations for the system outage probability and ergodic sum rate are analyzed based on the quality of service. Simulation results are provided to confirm the derived analytical results. The results show that the combination of SA and TWR-NOMA can decrease the outage probability and improve the diversity order effectively. The ergodic rates finally arise ceilings with both pSIC and ipSIC, and the ergodic sum rate can keep increasing as the power allocated to the distant user increases. However, the conventional TWR-NOMA is complete opposite. In summary, compared to TWR-NOMA, TWR-NOMA-SA has higher diversity order and enables distant users to contribute more to system performance.\n",

            " A 41-year-old man, without previous cardiological history, presented at the emergency department with hypotension and multi-organ failure. Laboratory testing showed elevated white cell blood count (16780/mcL; normal value 4000-11000/mcL; 90% neutrophils), high-sensibility troponin I (23247 ng/L; normal value <18 ng/L) and NT-pro-BNP (21914 pg/mL; normal value <300 pg/mL). At electrocardiogram (EKG) there was sinus rhythm with complete atrioventricular block and alternating right and left bundle branch block. Echocardiography revealed a moderate left ventricular (LV) dilatation, mild LV hypertrophy, severe biventricular dysfunction (LV Ejection Fraction - EF - 30%) with dense spontaneous echo contrast and moderate pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure 51 mmHg). After positioning a temporary pacemaker, the patient was transferred to our Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.\n",
            " After initial hemodynamic stabilization with endovenous inotropes, diuretics, and mechanical circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon pump), coronary angiography was performed showing normal coronary arteries.\n",
            " Since fulminant myocarditis was suspected and magnetic resonance was not feasible due to the patient's instability, an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was performed with the evidence of myocardial edema, initial myocardial fibrosis, and the concomitant presence of lymphocytic and eosinophilic endo-myocarditis (despite normal eosinophilic blood count) without evidence of active viral replication.\n",
            " After careful exclusion of latent or active infections, high doses of corticosteroids and azathioprine were initiated, with rapid laboratoristic and clinical response. EKG showed AV block regression and QRS width's normalization, so the pacemaker was removed. LVEF rapidly improved and was completely normalized at discharge after two weeks.\n",
            " In the early follow-up, a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed with evidence of persistency of mildly dilated LV, normalization of LV wall thickness and biventricular function, a diffuse increase of T1 relaxation time, increased T2 signal of the anterior and septal walls, and intramural anteroseptal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).\n",
            " Fulminant myocarditis is a rare presentation of acute myocarditis, with low incidence but high mortality. The inflammation of the myocardium itself leads to acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus arrest, AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation during the acute phase.\n",
            " In our case, AV block could be an expression of anteroseptal involvement, documented at CMR. This localization has already been associated with worse clinical presentation and could be a marker of poor prognosis.\n",
            " Diagnosis and treatment of fulminant myocarditis require EMB, to obtain information about the etiology and active viral replication in the heart tissue.

Firstly, the unmeasurable states are estimated by the fuzzy observer. Secondly, the quartic time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions are constructed to avoid the violation of time-varying constraints. Thirdly, the command filter technique and error compensation mechanism are incorporated into the controller design to get over the issue of “explosion of complexity” and compensate the filtered errors. Then, the event-triggered mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency in resource utilization. It is shown that the tracking error can converge to the desired neighborhood of the origin and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Finally, the validity of the control strategy is demonstrated by a physical example.\n",

            "Monitoring the dynamics of bacteria in porous media is of great significance to understand the bacterial transport and the interplay between bacteria and environmental factors. In this study, we reported a non-invasive, real-time, and efficient method to quantify bioluminescent bacterial concentration in water and sand media during flow-through experiments. First, 27 column experiments were conducted, and the bacterial transport was monitored using a real-time bioluminescent imaging system. Next, we quantified the bacterial concentration in water and sand media using two methods—viable count and bioluminescent count. The principle of the bioluminescent count in sand media was, for a given bioluminescence image, the total number of bacteria was proportionally allocated to each segment according to its bioluminescence intensity. We then compared the bacterial concentration for the two methods and found a good linear correlation between the bioluminescent count and viable count. Finally, the effects of porous media surface coating, pore water velocity, and ionic strength on the bioluminescent count in sand media were investigated, and the results showed that the bioluminescence counting accuracy was most affected by surface coating, followed by ionic strength, and was hardly affected by pore water velocity. Overall, the study proved that the bioluminescent count was a reliable method to quantify bacterial concentration in water (106 to 2 × 108 cell mL−1) or sand media (5 × 106-5 × 108 cell cm−3). This approach also offers a new way of thinking for in situ bacterial enumeration in two-dimensional devices such as 2D flow cells, microfluidic devices, and rhizoboxes.\n",

            "Rapid and real-time hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection in human blood or plasma is required as it has physiological and pathophysiological relations with human health. An ultrasensitive field-effect transistor (FET) using a layered transition metal dichalcogenides is demonstrated to detect dissolved H2S in plasma. The biosensor effectively utilizes a few layers of MoSe2 as a channel material for the FET device. The fabricated biosensor exhibited the highest response of 78 at the lowest H2S concentration of 1 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and a wide linear dynamic range (between 1 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and 1 mM). With the lowest detection limit of 1 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, the fabricated biosensor is appropriate for quick and real-time detection of H2S in plasma for point-of-care applications. In the concentration range of 1–100 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{M}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, the FET device shows linear change in its drain current and the threshold voltage. However, the fabricated device is still a proof of concept and could open new technological avenues for directly detecting all the forms of free sulfide in plasma with rapid, real-time, and stable sensing performance for point-of-care applications.\n",
